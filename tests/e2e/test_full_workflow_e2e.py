End-to-End Integration Tests - Full Workflow

Tests complete ResearchFlow system with real LLM calls, Docker PostgreSQL, and all components.

Test Scenarios:
1. Happy Path - Full workflow from request → complete (all approvals granted)
2. State Persistence - Save workflow state, restart, resume from checkpoint

Requirements:
- Docker services running (PostgreSQL + mock FHIR)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in environment
- FastAPI server running on localhost:8000
