## Release Notes

### Version 2.0.0 Highlights

**Major Enhancement: Human-in-Loop Approval Workflow**

ResearchFlow v2.0 introduces comprehensive human oversight capabilities that align with real-world clinical research workflows. Key highlights:

1. **SQL Safety**: No SQL query executes without informatician approval
2. **Scope Change Support**: Mid-workflow requirement modifications without restart
3. **Coordinator Agent**: Proactive workflow management and stakeholder communication
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every decision logged with timestamps and reviewers
5. **Enhanced Admin Dashboard**: Interactive approval interface with priority indicators

**Production Ready**: v2.0 includes all critical features for production deployment with appropriate human safety gates and compliance tracking.

### Upgrade Notes

#### From 1.x to 2.0

**Database Migration Required**

```bash
# Backup existing database
cp dev.db dev.db.backup

# Run migration script
python scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py

# Initialize approval table
python -c "import asyncio; from app.database import init_db; asyncio.run(init_db())"
```

**Configuration Changes**

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Approval workflow settings
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_REQUIREMENTS=24
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SQL=24
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_EXTRACTION=12
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_QA=24
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SCOPE_CHANGE=48
```

**Breaking Changes**
- WorkflowEngine states increased from 15 to 20
- New approval checkpoints pause workflow until human review
- Admin Dashboard URL remains http://localhost:8502 (no change)
- API endpoints backward compatible (no breaking changes)

**New Dependencies**
No new dependencies required - all changes use existing packages.
