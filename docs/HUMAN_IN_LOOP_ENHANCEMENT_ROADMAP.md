- [x] Reduce risk of incorrect data extraction
- [x] Enable human expert validation at critical points
- [x] Support scope changes and iterations
- [x] Improve stakeholder communication

---

## Gap Analysis Summary

### Current State vs Real-World Workflow

| Real-World Role | Current ResearchFlow | Gap Severity | Enhancement Needed |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Researcher submits form | [x] Researcher Portal + Requirements Agent | None | - |
| Informatician translates to SQL | [x] Phenotype Agent generates SQL | **HIGH** | [ ] No human SQL review |
| Informatician performs QA | [x] QA Agent validates | Low | [x] Already automated |
| Submit via REDCap | WARNING: Generic delivery | **MEDIUM** | [ ] REDCap integration |
| Admin coordinates meetings/emails | WARNING: Calendar Agent (meetings only) | **HIGH** | [ ] No email/scope coordination |
| Handle scope changes | [ ] Not supported | **CRITICAL** | [ ] Must restart workflow |

### Critical Gaps Identified

**Gap #1: Missing SQL Approval Checkpoint** (CRITICAL)
- **Real**: Informatician reviews and approves SQL before execution
- **Current**: Auto-generates and executes without review
- **Risk**: Incorrect queries, data quality issues
- **Solution**: Add `phenotype_review` state with human approval

**Gap #2: No Coordinator/Admin Agent** (HIGH)
- **Real**: Admin staff coordinate emails, scope changes, stakeholders
- **Current**: Only Calendar Agent for meetings
- **Risk**: Poor stakeholder communication, no scope change support
- **Solution**: Create CoordinatorAgent with email/scope capabilities

**Gap #3: Requirements Bypass Informatician** (MEDIUM)
- **Real**: Informatician works WITH researcher to clarify
- **Current**: LLM extracts everything alone
- **Risk**: Misinterpretation of complex clinical concepts
- **Solution**: Add informatician review after requirements extraction

**Gap #4: REDCap Integration Missing** (MEDIUM)
- **Real**: Standard delivery via REDCap
- **Current**: Generic file packaging
- **Solution**: Add REDCap delivery option

**Gap #5: Reactive Escalation Only** (MEDIUM)
- **Real**: Proactive admin management
- **Current**: Only escalates on failures
- **Solution**: Add proactive escalation triggers

---

## Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Approvals (Week 1-2) - **8-10 hours**

#### 1.1 Add Approval Workflow States [x]
**File**: `app/orchestrator/workflow_engine.py`

```python
class WorkflowState(Enum):
 # Existing states...

 # NEW APPROVAL STATES
 REQUIREMENTS_REVIEW = "requirements_review"
 PHENOTYPE_REVIEW = "phenotype_review"
 EXTRACTION_APPROVAL = "extraction_approval"
 QA_REVIEW = "qa_review"
 SCOPE_CHANGE = "scope_change"
```

**Changes**:
- Add 5 new approval states
- Update transition rules for human gates
- Add approval timeout handling

#### 1.2 Create Approval Database Model [x]
**File**: `app/database/models.py`

```python
class Approval(Base):
 """Human approval tracking"""
 __tablename__ = "approvals"

 id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
 request_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("research_requests.id"))
 approval_type = Column(String) # requirements, phenotype_sql, extraction, qa

 # Request details
 submitted_at = Column(DateTime)
 submitted_by = Column(String) # agent_id
 approval_data = Column(JSON) # What needs approval

 # Review
 status = Column(String) # pending, approved, rejected, modified
 reviewed_at = Column(DateTime)
 reviewed_by = Column(String) # user_id or email
 review_notes = Column(Text)
 modifications = Column(JSON)
```

#### 1.3 Add Informatician SQL Review Checkpoint [x]
**Flow**:
1. Phenotype Agent generates SQL
2. Transition to `phenotype_review` state
3. Create Approval record with SQL
4. Notify informatician (email/dashboard)
5. Wait for approval
6. On approval → proceed to calendar scheduling
7. On rejection → return to phenotype agent with feedback

#### 1.4 Add Requirements Review Checkpoint [x]
**Flow**:
1. Requirements Agent completes extraction
2. Transition to `requirements_review` state
3. Create Approval record with requirements
4. Informatician reviews for medical accuracy
5. On approval → proceed to phenotype
6. On modification → update and re-review

---

### Phase 2: Coordinator Agent (Week 3-4) - **12-15 hours**

#### 2.1 Create Coordinator Agent [x]
**File**: `app/agents/coordinator_agent.py`

```python
class CoordinatorAgent(BaseAgent):
 """
 Proactive workflow coordination and stakeholder management

 Responsibilities:
 - Manage scope changes
 - Coordinate stakeholder communication
 - Send email updates
 - Handle timeline negotiations
 - Escalate proactively based on thresholds
 """

 async def manage_scope_change(self, context):
 """Handle researcher-initiated scope changes"""

 async def send_stakeholder_update(self, context):
 """Email progress updates"""

 async def coordinate_approval(self, context):
 """Coordinate human approvals"""

 async def handle_timeline_negotiation(self, context):
 """Manage timeline discussions"""
```

#### 2.2 Implement Scope Change Workflow [x]
**New States**:
- `scope_change` → when researcher requests changes
- `scope_review` → informatician reviews new scope
- Ability to return to ANY previous state

**Flow**:
```
Any State → Scope Change Request
 ↓
Coordinator Agent analyzes impact
 ↓
Create scope change approval
 ↓
Informatician reviews
 ↓
If approved → Restart from appropriate state
If rejected → Continue current flow
```

#### 2.3 Add Email Coordination [x]
**Integration Points**:
- After requirements complete → email researcher confirmation
- After SQL generation → email informatician for review
- Before extraction → email execution notice
- After QA → email results summary
- On scope change → email all stakeholders

**Implementation**:
- MCP email server stub
- Email templates for each event
- Email queue for async sending

---

### Phase 3: Enhanced Escalation (Week 5) - **6-8 hours**

#### 3.1 Proactive Escalation Triggers [x]
**File**: `app/agents/base_agent.py`

Add proactive escalation beyond failures:
- **Time threshold**: Request open > 48 hours without progress
- **Approval pending**: Waiting > 24 hours for human approval
- **Feasibility marginal**: Cohort < 50% of minimum
- **Data availability low**: < 50% availability for key elements
- **Complexity high**: > 10 data elements or complex criteria

#### 3.2 Escalation Routing [x]
**Enhanced Escalation Model**:
```python
class Escalation(Base):
 # Existing fields...

 # NEW FIELDS
 escalation_reason = Column(String) # timeout, low_feasibility, complexity, approval_pending
 severity = Column(String) # low, medium, high, critical
 recommended_action = Column(Text) # AI-suggested next steps
 auto_resolved = Column(Boolean, default=False)
 resolution_agent = Column(String) # Which agent resolved it
```

---

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard Enhancements (Week 6) - **8-10 hours**

#### 4.1 Approval Interface [x]
**File**: `app/web_ui/admin_dashboard.py`

**New Tab**: "Pending Approvals"
- List all pending approvals
- Show approval details (SQL, requirements, etc.)
- Approve/Reject/Modify interface
- Bulk approval actions
- Email preview before approval

#### 4.2 Scope Change Management UI [x]
