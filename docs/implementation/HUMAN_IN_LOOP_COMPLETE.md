# Human-in-Loop Enhancement - Implementation Complete [x]

**Implementation Date**: October 2025
**Status**: [x] Complete
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Critical Approvals + Scope Change Workflow

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented human-in-loop approval gates at critical decision points in ResearchFlow, addressing gaps between automated workflow and real-world clinical research processes. The system now requires informatician approval for SQL queries before execution, supports scope changes mid-workflow, and provides comprehensive coordination capabilities.

---

## [x] Components Implemented

### 1. **Workflow Engine Enhancements**
**File**: `app/orchestrator/workflow_engine.py`

- [x] Added 5 new approval states:

 - `QA_REVIEW` - Informatician validates QA results
 - `SCOPE_CHANGE` - Review scope changes

- [x] Updated workflow transition rules (14 new rules)
- [x] Added helper methods:

- On rejection → returns to phenotype agent with feedback

**Validation**: SQL **cannot execute** without informatician approval

---

**Status**: Complete
**Impact**: HIGH - Enables scope changes and stakeholder coordination

**Implementation**:
- Built `CoordinatorAgent` with 10 methods

## Workflow Transformation

### Before (Automated, No Review)
```
Requirements → Phenotype → Calendar → Extraction → QA → Delivery
```

### After (Human-in-Loop Gates)
```
Requirements → [REVIEW ] → Phenotype → [SQL REVIEW ] → Calendar →
[APPROVAL ] → Extraction → QA → [REVIEW ] → Delivery
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Requirements must be reviewed for medical accuracy
2. **SQL must be approved before execution** (CRITICAL)
3. Extraction requires approval to begin
4. QA results must be validated
5. Scope changes supported at any point

---

## NOTE: Usage Example

### Complete Approval Workflow

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

# 1. Researcher submits request
# (triggers requirements_agent)

# 2. Get pending requirements approval
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/approvals/pending?approval_type=requirements")
approval = response.json()['approvals'][0]

# 3. Informatician approves requirements
requests.post(
 f"{BASE_URL}/approvals/{approval['id']}/respond",
 json={
 "decision": "approve",
 "reviewer": "informatician@hospital.org",
 "notes": "Requirements validated for medical accuracy"
 }
)

# 4. Workflow continues to phenotype_agent (generates SQL)

# 5. Get pending SQL approval
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/approvals/pending?approval_type=phenotype_sql")
sql_approval = response.json()['approvals'][0]

# 6. Informatician reviews SQL
sql_query = sql_approval['approval_data']['sql_query']
print(f"SQL to review: {sql_query}")

# 7. Approve SQL (CRITICAL CHECKPOINT)
requests.post(
 f"{BASE_URL}/approvals/{sql_approval['id']}/respond",
 json={
 "decision": "approve",
 "reviewer": "informatician@hospital.org",
 "notes": "SQL query validated against FHIR schema"
 }
)

# 8. Workflow continues to calendar_agent, then extraction, QA, delivery
```

### Scope Change Example

```python
# Researcher requests scope change mid-workflow
requests.post(
 f"{BASE_URL}/approvals/scope-change",
 json={
 "request_id": "REQ-20251011-ABC123",
 "requested_by": "researcher@hospital.org",
 "requested_changes": {
 "inclusion_criteria": [
 "Patients with diabetes type 2",
 "Age >= 50" # NEW
 ]
 },
 "reason": "IRB requested age restriction"
 }
)

# Response includes impact analysis:
# {
# "success": true,
# "approval_id": 5,
# "impact_analysis": {
# "severity": "high",
# "requires_rework": true,
# "restart_from_state": "requirements_gathering",
# "estimated_delay_hours": 24,
# "affected_components": ["phenotype", "extraction", "qa"]
# }
# }
```

---

## Email Notification Flow

1. **Requirements Complete** → Email to informatician with review link
2. **SQL Generated** → Email to informatician with SQL query and warnings
3. **Extraction Approved** → Email to researcher with notice
4. **QA Complete** → Email to researcher with QA summary
5. **Scope Change Requested** → Email to all stakeholders with impact analysis

**Current Status**: Email templates implemented, logging only (MCP email server pending)

---

## ⏱ Timeout Configuration

| Approval Type | Timeout | Action on Timeout |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| Requirements | 24 hours | Escalate to admin |
| Phenotype SQL | 24 hours | **Escalate to admin (CRITICAL)** |
| Extraction | 12 hours | Escalate to admin |
| QA | 24 hours | Escalate to admin |
| Scope Change | 48 hours | Escalate to admin |

**Timeout Handling**:
- Automatic detection via `/approvals/check-timeouts` (call hourly)
- Creates escalation record with severity "high"
- Notifies admin for immediate action
- Tracks timeout in approval record

---
