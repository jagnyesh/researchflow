## Integration Points Tested

### [x] Database Layer
- ApprovalService CRUD operations
- SQLAlchemy async queries
- Transaction management
- Foreign key relationships

### [x] API Layer
- FastAPI endpoint routing
- Pydantic validation
- Error handling
- JSON serialization

### [x] Business Logic
- Approval status transitions
- Reviewer assignment
- Modification tracking
- Rejection handling

---

## Known Limitations (By Design)

### Orchestrator Integration
**Status**: Deferred for UI testing

The `/approvals/{id}/respond` endpoint currently works without orchestrator integration for testing purposes. This allows:
- [x] Approval status updates
- [x] Reviewer tracking
- [x] Modification storage
- [ ] Automatic workflow continuation (requires orchestrator)

**Production Deployment**: Will require orchestrator initialization in `app/main.py` to enable full workflow continuation after approvals.

### Email Notifications
**Status**: Logging only

Coordinator agent email notifications are currently logged but not sent. Integration with MCP email server is pending.

---

## UI Testing Ready

The system is now ready for manual UI testing:

### Test Steps:
1. **Open Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:8502
2. **Navigate to "Pending Approvals" tab**
3. **Verify display of 7 pending approvals**:
 - Extraction (ID: 4, 9)
 - QA (ID: 5, 10)
 - Requirements (ID: 6)
 - Phenotype SQL (ID: 7) - should auto-expand as CRITICAL
 - Scope Change (ID: 8)

4. **Test SQL Review Card** (ID: 7):
 - [x] SQL query displayed with syntax highlighting
 - [x] Estimated cohort: 347
 - [x] Feasibility score: 0.87
 - [x] Warnings displayed
 - [x] Recommendations shown

5. **Test Scope Change Card** (ID: 8):
 - [x] Impact analysis displayed
 - [x] Severity indicator ( High)
 - [x] Cohort reduction percentage shown
 - [x] Affected components listed

6. **Test Action Buttons**:
 - [x] Approve button
 - [x] Modify & Approve button (with inline editor)
 - [x] Reject button (with reason text area)

7. **Test Filtering**:
 - [x] Filter by "Phenotype SQL"
 - [x] Filter by "Scope Change"
 - [x] "All" filter shows all pending
