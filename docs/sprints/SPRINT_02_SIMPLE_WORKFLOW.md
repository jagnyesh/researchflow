# Sprint 02: Simple StateGraph Workflow

**Duration:** 1 week
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Branch:** `feature/langchain-langgraph-exploration`
**Sprint Goal:** Build 3-state proof of concept with LangGraph and compare with custom FSM
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-25

---

## Goal

Build a simple 3-state workflow using LangGraph's StateGraph to evaluate:
1. **Code Simplicity**: Is StateGraph simpler than custom FSM?
2. **Conditional Routing**: Is routing logic clearer?
3. **Visualization**: Is diagram generation automatic?
4. **State Management**: Is TypedDict cleaner than manual tracking?

This is a proof-of-concept to determine if LangGraph should replace the custom workflow_engine.py (15 states, ~300 lines).

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

**`app/langchain_orchestrator/simple_workflow.py`** (281 lines)

Key components:
- `WorkflowState` TypedDict with 11 fields (enforces state schema)
- `SimpleWorkflow` class with `_build_graph()` method
- 3 state handlers: `_handle_new_request`, `_handle_requirements_gathering`, `_handle_complete`
- Conditional routing function: `_route_after_requirements`
- Automatic diagram generation: `get_graph_diagram()`

**Workflow States:**
1. **new_request** - Entry point, initializes request
2. **requirements_gathering** - Simulates Requirements Agent (Sprint 3 will integrate real agent)
3. **complete** - Terminal state

**State Transitions:**
```
new_request ‚Üí requirements_gathering ‚Üí complete (if requires_approval=True)
new_request ‚Üí requirements_gathering ‚Üí END (if needs more conversation)
```

**Key Implementation Pattern:**
```python
class WorkflowState(TypedDict):
    """Type-safe state schema - LangGraph enforces this"""
    request_id: str
    current_state: str
    researcher_request: str
    researcher_info: dict
    requirements: dict
    conversation_history: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    completeness_score: float
    requires_approval: bool
    error: str | None
    created_at: str
    updated_at: str

class SimpleWorkflow:
    def _build_graph(self) -> StateGraph:
        graph = StateGraph(WorkflowState)

        # Declarative node definition
        graph.add_node("new_request", self._handle_new_request)
        graph.add_node("requirements_gathering", self._handle_requirements_gathering)
        graph.add_node("complete", self._handle_complete)

        # Declarative edge definition
        graph.set_entry_point("new_request")
        graph.add_edge("new_request", "requirements_gathering")

        # Conditional routing (cleaner than if/elif chains)
        graph.add_conditional_edges(
            "requirements_gathering",
            self._route_after_requirements,
            {"complete": "complete", "wait_for_input": END}
        )

        graph.add_edge("complete", END)
        return graph
```

**vs. Custom FSM (workflow_engine.py):**
```python
# Custom FSM - Manual transition table
TRANSITIONS = {
    "new_request": {"next_state": "requirements_gathering", "condition": None},
    "requirements_gathering": {
        "next_state": ["feasibility_validation", "requirements_gathering"],
        "condition": "check_requirements_complete"
    },
    # ... 15 states total, complex nested conditions
}

def transition(self, current_state, context):
    # Manual if/elif chain to determine next state
    if current_state == "requirements_gathering":
        if context.get("requires_approval"):
            return "feasibility_validation"
        else:
            return "requirements_gathering"
    # ... error-prone logic
```

**`tests/test_simple_workflow.py`** (303 lines, 15 tests)

Test coverage:
- State transitions (new_request ‚Üí requirements_gathering ‚Üí complete)
- Conditional routing (complete vs wait_for_input)
- Individual state handlers
- Full workflow execution (with ready requirements)
- State updates (timestamps)
- Diagram generation
- Type safety (TypedDict validation)
- Graph structure

## Workflow Diagram

**Automatic Mermaid Diagram Generated:**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    __start__([__start__]):::first
    new_request(new_request)
    requirements_gathering(requirements_gathering)
    complete(complete)
    __end__([__end__]):::last
    __start__ --> new_request;
    new_request --> requirements_gathering;
    requirements_gathering -. wait_for_input .-> __end__;
    requirements_gathering -.-> complete;
    complete --> __end__;
    classDef default fill:#f2f0ff,line-height:1.2
    classDef first fill-opacity:0
    classDef last fill:#bfb6fc
```

**Diagram saved to:** `docs/sprints/simple_workflow_diagram.mmd`

**Comparison with Custom FSM:**
- Custom: No automatic visualization (manual PlantUML creation required)
- LangGraph: `workflow.get_graph_diagram()` generates Mermaid automatically
- Verdict: LangGraph wins (automatic visualization is a major productivity boost)

---

## Key Findings

### What Worked Well ‚úÖ

1. **Declarative Graph Building**
   - `add_node()`, `add_edge()`, `add_conditional_edges()` are intuitive
   - Much clearer than manual transition tables
   - Easy to understand workflow at a glance

2. **Type-Safe State Schema**
   - `TypedDict` enforces state shape at development time
   - Prevents bugs from missing/misspelled state fields
   - Better than untyped dicts in custom FSM

3. **Automatic Visualization**
   - `get_graph_diagram()` generates Mermaid diagrams automatically
   - No manual PlantUML creation needed
   - Diagrams stay in sync with code

4. **Conditional Routing**
   - Routing functions (`_route_after_requirements`) are clean and testable
   - Better than scattered if/elif logic in custom orchestrator
   - Easy to add new routing conditions

5. **State Management**
   - LangGraph handles state passing automatically between nodes
   - No manual state copying/merging needed
   - Reduces boilerplate code

6. **Test Coverage**
   - All 15 tests passed on first run (after fixing infinite loop)
   - Easy to test individual state handlers (pure functions)
   - Workflow execution is predictable

### What Didn't Work (Challenges) ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Initial Infinite Loop**
   - **Problem:** First implementation had `"continue": "requirements_gathering"` in routing, causing infinite recursion
   - **Solution:** Changed to `"wait_for_input": END` to stop and wait for more user input
   - **Learning:** LangGraph workflows should route to END when waiting for external input, not loop

2. **State Initialization**
   - **Problem:** `_handle_new_request` was resetting pre-set values like `requires_approval`
   - **Solution:** Changed to only initialize fields if not already present (`if "key" not in state`)
   - **Learning:** State handlers should be defensive and preserve existing values

3. **Learning Curve**
   - **Challenge:** Need to understand StateGraph concepts (nodes, edges, conditional edges, END)
   - **Impact:** Medium - took some trial and error to get routing right
   - **Mitigation:** Good documentation and examples in LangGraph docs

### Surprises / Learnings üí°

1. **Simplicity Wins**
   - StateGraph is conceptually simple: nodes + edges + routing functions
   - No complex abstractions needed for most use cases
   - Declarative style is easier to reason about than imperative

2. **Visualization is Powerful**
   - Automatic diagram generation is a game-changer for documentation
   - Diagrams stay in sync with code (no manual updates needed)
   - Makes workflows self-documenting

3. **Type Safety Catches Bugs**
   - TypedDict caught several bugs during development (missing fields, wrong types)
   - Much better than runtime errors in production
   - Static type checkers (mypy) can validate state schema

4. **Testing is Easier**
   - State handlers are pure functions (input state ‚Üí output state)
   - Easy to test in isolation
   - Conditional routing functions are also pure and testable

| Performance | TBD (Sprint 4) | TBD (Sprint 4) | TBD |
| Debugging | Custom logging | LangSmith integration | LangGraph |

**Overall Winner:** LangGraph (8/10 categories)

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Infinite Loop (GraphRecursionError)

**Problem:** Initial implementation caused infinite recursion:
```python
# WRONG - causes infinite loop
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "requirements_gathering",
    self._route_after_requirements,
    {"complete": "complete", "continue": "requirements_gathering"}  # Loops forever!
)
```

**Solution:** Route to END instead of looping back:
```python
# CORRECT - stops and waits for user input
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "requirements_gathering",
    self._route_after_requirements,
    {"complete": "complete", "wait_for_input": END}  # Stops gracefully
)
```

**Impact:** 2 hours to debug and fix

**Learning:** LangGraph workflows should route to END when waiting for external input (user conversation, API calls, etc.)

---

### Challenge 2: State Initialization Reset

**Problem:** Tests with pre-set `requires_approval=True` were failing because `_handle_new_request` was resetting it to `False`:
```python
# WRONG - resets pre-existing values
def _handle_new_request(self, state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    state["requires_approval"] = False  # Overwrites pre-set value!
```

**Solution:** Only initialize if not already present:
```python
# CORRECT - preserves pre-existing values
def _handle_new_request(self, state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    if "requires_approval" not in state:
        state["requires_approval"] = False  # Only set if missing
```

**Impact:** 1 hour to identify and fix

**Learning:** State handlers should be defensive and only initialize missing fields, not overwrite existing ones

---

## Code Analysis

### Complexity Comparison

**Custom FSM (workflow_engine.py):**
- Cyclomatic Complexity: High (many nested if/elif chains)
- Transition logic scattered across multiple functions
- Hard to visualize workflow without manual diagram

**LangGraph StateGraph (simple_workflow.py):**
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Low (declarative graph building)
- Transition logic centralized in `_build_graph()` and routing functions
- Automatic visualization with `get_graph_diagram()`

**Verdict:** LangGraph is simpler and more maintainable

- üìã Goal: Implement complete 15-state workflow with all 6 agents integrated

---

## Next Sprint Dependencies

**Blocking Issues:**
- None currently

**Prerequisites for Sprint 3 (Full 15-State Workflow):**
- Sprint 2 recommendation must be "Proceed" ‚úÖ
- LangGraph approach validated (3-state proof of concept works) ‚úÖ
