# Research Notebook Improvements - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the major improvements made to the Research Notebook to implement a conversational two-stage workflow with proper approval gates.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. **No Conversational AI**
- Typing "hi" immediately executed SQL queries instead of showing an introduction
- No intent detection (greeting vs. query vs. status check)

### 2. **No Summary Statistics Before Extraction**
- Users were not shown feasibility results (cohort size, data availability) before committing to extraction
- No confirmation step before submitting formal data requests

### 3. **Missing Approval Workflow**
- No informatician SQL review before query execution (CRITICAL security gap)
- Requests created but no approvals generated
- Approvals not visible in Admin Dashboard

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Conversational AI Layer** (`app/services/conversation_manager.py`)

**Intent Detection:**
- `GREETING` - Shows introduction and capabilities
- `QUERY` - Triggers feasibility check
- `CONFIRMATION` - Processes "yes/no" responses
- `STATUS_CHECK` - Shows request progress
- `HELP` - Displays help message

**Response Formatting:**
- Introduction with system capabilities
- Feasibility results with warnings and recommendations
- Approval status with workflow visualization

### 2. **Two-Stage Query Execution**

#### **Stage 1: Feasibility Check (SQL-on-FHIR v2)**
- **Purpose:** Fast cohort size estimation without PHI exposure
- **Query Type:** COUNT queries only
- **Approval:** NOT required (no data extraction)
- **Speed:** ~1-2 seconds
- **Implementation:** `app/services/feasibility_service.py`

**Workflow:**
```
User Query
    ↓
Query Interpreter (LLM)
    ↓
SQL-on-FHIR COUNT Queries
    ↓
Feasibility Results
    ↓
Show to User: "5 patients estimated, proceed?"
```

#### **Stage 2: Data Extraction (Multi-Agent Orchestrator)**
- **Purpose:** Full data extraction with PHI
- **Query Type:** Full SELECT queries with all columns
- **Approval:** REQUIRED (informatician SQL review)
- **Speed:** 15-30 minutes
- **Implementation:** Multi-agent workflow

**Workflow:**
```
User Confirms "yes"
    ↓
Submit Request with Structured Requirements
    ↓
Requirements Agent (skips conversation)
    ↓
Creates Approval (informatician review)
    ↓
Wait for Approval
    ↓
Phenotype Agent → Extraction → QA → Delivery
```

### 3. **Approval Workflow Integration**

**Fixed:**
- Research API now accepts pre-structured requirements
- Requirements Agent recognizes pre-structured requirements and completes immediately
- Approval created automatically after requirements complete
- Request transitions to "requirements_review" state
- Approval visible in Admin Dashboard

**Key Changes:**
1. `app/api/research.py` - Updated `/research/process/{request_id}` endpoint to accept `structured_requirements` and `skip_conversation` flag
2. `app/agents/requirements_agent.py` - Added logic to handle pre-structured requirements without conversation
3. `app/web_ui/research_notebook.py` - Builds structured requirements from feasibility data

## Architecture: SQL-on-FHIR vs. Clinical Data Warehouse

### **SQL-on-FHIR v2 (In-Memory Runner)**
- **Used For:** Feasibility checks (Stage 1)
- **Advantages:**
  - No database load
  - Fast execution (~1-2 seconds)
  - ViewDefinition standardization
  - Safe (COUNT queries only, no PHI)
  - No approval required

### **Clinical Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL)**
- **Used For:** Full data extraction (Stage 2)
- **Advantages:**
  - Complete data access
  - Complex joins and filtering
  - Historical data
  - Audit trail
- **Requirements:**
  - Informatician SQL review
  - Approval workflow
  - PHI safeguards

## Testing & Verification

### Automated Test Results

```bash
python scripts/test_research_notebook_workflow.py
```

**Results:**
```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
   - Request created: REQ-20251013-29D3CEF9
   - Approvals created: 1
   - Pending approvals visible: 1
   - Final state: requirements_review
```

### Manual Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Greeting Detection
1. Open Research Notebook: http://localhost:8501
2. Type: **"hi"**
3. Expected: Introduction message with capabilities (NO SQL execution)

#### Test 2: Feasibility Check
1. Type: **"Patients with diabetes"**
2. Expected:
   - Feasibility analysis shown
   - Estimated cohort size
   - Data availability by element
   - Warnings and recommendations
   - Prompt: "Would you like to proceed with full data extraction?"

#### Test 3: Full Extraction Request
1. Type: **"yes"**
2. Expected:
   - Request submitted successfully
   - Request ID shown (e.g., REQ-20251013-XXXXXXXX)
   - Message: "Awaiting informatician SQL review"
   - Approval created in database

#### Test 4: Admin Dashboard Visibility
1. Open Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:8502
2. Navigate to **"Pending Approvals"** tab
3. Expected:
   - New request appears in list
   - Approval type: "requirements"
   - Status: "pending"
   - Informatician can review and approve

#### Test 5: Status Check
1. In Research Notebook, type: **"status"**
2. Expected:

2. Database initialized: `ls -la dev.db`
3. Request processed: `GET /research/{request_id}`
4. Approvals created: `GET /approvals/request/{request_id}`

### Feasibility Check Fails

**Check:**
1. SQL-on-FHIR runner initialized
2. ViewDefinitions loaded
3. FHIR server accessible (if using external)

### Greeting Detection Not Working

**Check:**
1. ConversationManager initialized in session state
2. Intent detection keywords configured
3. Streamlit session state persisted
