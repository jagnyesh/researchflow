# ResearchFlow — Current State

**Sprint:** 6.1 (Security Baseline)
**Phase:** 3a complete — moving to 3b next
**Branch:** `feature/sprint6-security-baseline` (19 commits unmerged: 8 audit + 8 schema + 3 TLS)
**Overall progress:** ~85% of Sprint 6.1 complete; ~10/22 sprints overall
**Last updated:** 2026-05-07

## Active sprint goal

Establish HIPAA-compliant security baseline so ResearchFlow can host institutional pilot conversations: JWT auth wired to PHI endpoints, audit middleware writing to a durable Redis-backed queue, input validation framework, TLS, encryption-at-rest design.

## In progress

- [ ] Phase 1.5 — Wire `Depends(get_current_user)` + `@limiter.limit` onto PHI routes (`sql_on_fhir`, `research`, `analytics`, `materialized_views`, `approvals`); separate service-token auth for agent routes (`mcp`, `a2a`). **Note:** Phase 2.2 middleware now enforces auth on ALL non-allowlisted routes by default; the per-route `Depends` work in this phase is now defense-in-depth rather than primary gating.
- [x] Phase 2.2 — Audit pipeline shipped via 3 issues + CSO review.
- [x] Phase 2.3 — Input validation framework shipped via 3 issues + CSO review.
- [x] Phase 3a — TLS enforcement (HTTPS redirect + HSTS) shipped via 1 issue. See "What just shipped" below.
- [ ] Phase 3b — Encryption-at-rest: `sqlalchemy-utils.StringEncryptedType` on Tier 1 freeform-PHI columns — `ResearchRequest.initial_request`, `ResearchRequest.structured_requirements`, `RequirementsData.inclusion_criteria`, `RequirementsData.exclusion_criteria`, `FeasibilityReport.phenotype_sql`. Researcher PII (`*.researcher_email`, `User.email`, `User.full_name`) is out of scope — it's PII, not ePHI under §164.312, and `User.email` is the unique-indexed login key. Half-day spike to verify asyncpg + JSON-column composition.
- [ ] Phase 4 — E2E test (login → SQL query → audit row visible) + remaining `docs/HIPAA_POSTURE.md` sections (Phase 2.2 + 2.3 + 3a already drafted)

**Estimated remaining:** 5-9 working days = 1.5-2 calendar weeks (Phase 3a done; ~half day vs original 1-day estimate)

## Blockers / decisions needed

- Encryption-at-rest spike: `sqlalchemy-utils.StringEncryptedType` works at the column level on both SQLite and Postgres (it's transparent serialization, not a DB feature). The asyncpg-specific risk is the JSON-column composition (`StringEncryptedType` wrapping a JSON serializer round-trip) — that's the half-day spike. SQLite test path stays; production-on-Postgres remains the deployment requirement for other reasons.
- No external pilot user identified. Sprint 6.1 finish-line decision was "ship sales-grade HIPAA posture" — not "wait for users." Outreach is parallel work, not a blocker.

Sprint 6.1 Phase 2.2 — audit pipeline (8 commits on `feature/sprint6-security-baseline`, 74 audit tests):

- `e5a094b` (2026-05-03) — wire E2E test for Issue #2 auth + explicit SQLite to bypass stale .env Postgres
- `d277723` (2026-05-03) — Finding 2 fix: gate detailed health payload behind auth (two-tier `/health/ready` + `/health/ready/detailed`)
- `a7840fa` (2026-05-03) — Finding 3 fix: correct schema versioning claim in HIPAA doc
- `1b30e5c` (2026-05-03) — Finding 1 fix: allow `/a2a/token` through middleware (bootstrap deadlock)
- `d9a595c` (2026-05-03) — Issue #3: at-least-once durability + drain supervision + `/health/ready` + `docs/HIPAA_POSTURE.md` Phase 2.2 section
- `2183ed5` (2026-05-03) — Issue #2: default-deny classifier + fail-closed pre/post pair + middleware-side JWT decode
- `744b328` (2026-05-03) — Issue #1: tracer bullet — audit one PHI route end-to-end

Earlier in Sprint 6.1:

- `c3e0280` (2026-05-02) — admin dashboard graceful handling when DB unreachable
- `803152b` (Phase 2.1) — HIPAA-compliant audit logging *schema* (table only; middleware shipped in Phase 2.2)
- `5476255` (Phase 1.4) — API rate limiting via SlowAPI
- `3e8e877` (Phase 1.3) — bcrypt password hashing
- `db8b406` (Phase 1.2) — user management CRUD endpoints
- `36062af` (Phase 1.1) — JWT authentication

## Key numbers

- Tests: LangGraph migration suite covers `test_agent_adapter.py` (24), `test_approval_bridge.py` (26), `test_langgraph_persistence.py` (14), `test_langgraph_workflow.py` (20), plus E2E. Phase 2.2 audit pipeline adds 74 tests across 8 new test files (classifier, principal, middleware, drain, drain_v2, main_wiring, resource_map, health).
- Agents: 6 production agents (Requirements, Phenotype, Calendar, Extraction, QA, Delivery)
- Workflow nodes: 15 in custom FSM (`app/orchestrator/`, production) + 17 in LangGraph FSM (`app/langchain_orchestrator/langgraph_workflow.py`, behind `USE_LANGGRAPH_WORKFLOW` flag)
- Performance: 10-100x query speedup from materialized views; <10ms Redis speed-layer latency
- SQL injection: 30 vulnerabilities fixed in Sprint 6 (parameterized queries everywhere)
- Staleness flagged: CLAUDE.md previously claimed "23-state" (actual: 17 nodes) and "12 LangSmith integration tests" (actual: 1 in `test_langsmith_integration.py`). Treat any unverified count from archived sprint reports the same way.
