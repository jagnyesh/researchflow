## Option C (RECOMMENDED): General Audience - PMs and Technical Leaders

**Making the transition from biomedical informatician to Product Manager taught me which work needs experts and which needs coordination.**

The insight came from analyzing my own time as an informatician supporting clinical research:

**~50% Administrative PM Work:**
- Scheduling stakeholder meetings
- Routing requests between teams (researchers → informaticians → biostatisticians → IRB)
- Tracking workflow status (15 states from submission to delivery)
- Sending status updates and notifications
- Coordinating approval workflows
- Managing escalations

**~50% Technical Expertise:**
- Validating SQL queries against complex FHIR data models
- Reviewing phenotype definitions for clinical accuracy
- Ensuring computational validity of cohort calculations
- Approving de-identification methods based on data use agreements
- QA validation of datasets

The administrative work was essential but didn't require years of informatics training. The technical work? Absolutely required domain expertise.

**The Experiment:**

I built ResearchFlow - an AI-powered multi-agent system for clinical research automation - entirely using agentic AI coding (Claude Code). The meta-experiment: Can AI build AI that handles the PM work I used to do?

**The Architecture:**

Seven AI agents orchestrate the entire workflow using LangGraph (state machine with 20 workflow states):
- Requirements extraction from natural language
- SQL-on-FHIR query generation (1151x faster than REST API)
- Stakeholder meeting scheduling
- Multi-source data extraction
- Quality assurance automation
- Data packaging and delivery
- Approval workflow coordination

**But here's the critical design:**

Informaticians and biostatisticians remain as mandatory approval gates:
- No SQL executes without informatician review
- No requirements proceed without validation
- No data extracts without authorization
- No datasets deliver without QA approval

**The Result:**

- **AI handles:** All administrative coordination (routing, scheduling, status tracking, notifications)
- **SMEs validate:** All technical decisions (SQL queries, computations, data quality)
- **Outcome:** Weeks → Hours turnaround, but 100% expert validation maintained

**The Broader Insight:**

Building AI with AI proved the concept. Administrative PM work - the coordination, orchestration, and routing - is exactly where AI should own the workflow.

Subject matter experts should spend 100% of their time on what they're irreplaceable for: technical judgment.

I've open-sourced ResearchFlow (MIT License) because this architecture - AI for coordination, humans for expertise - shows a sustainable path for AI in healthcare and other regulated technical domains.

**Observability Proof:**

The system uses LangSmith for full observability - every workflow trace shows exactly what AI handled vs. what required human validation. You can literally see the division of labor: AI orchestrating 18,000+ lines of coordination logic, humans approving technical decisions at defined gates. The traces prove the architecture works.

**For fellow PMs and technical leaders:** Where have you found the clearest boundaries between administrative coordination (AI-ready) and irreplaceable expertise (human-essential) in your domain?

## Option D: Technical Audience - AI Engineers and Architects

**I built a production multi-agent system using AI to prove where AI should own workflows.**

As a biomedical informatician transitioning to Product Management, I spent years supporting clinical research data requests. The work split cleanly: 50% administrative coordination, 50% technical validation requiring deep expertise.

Only the technical half needed a human with a master's degree.

**The Experiment:**

I built ResearchFlow - a 7-agent AI system that automates clinical research workflows from natural language request to data delivery - entirely using agentic AI coding (Claude Code). 18,000+ lines of production code generated through AI-assisted development.

**Production Architecture:**

**Orchestration Layer:**
- LangGraph state machine managing 20 workflow states
- Multi-agent coordination with persistent state management
- LangSmith observability for full workflow tracing
- Every agent execution traceable to show AI vs. human decision points

**Agent Specialization:**
1. Requirements Agent: LLM-powered conversation for requirements extraction
2. Phenotype Agent: SQL-on-FHIR v2 ViewDefinitions (1151x faster than REST API)
3. Calendar Agent: Intelligent meeting scheduling with stakeholder routing
4. Extraction Agent: Multi-source data retrieval with batching
5. QA Agent: Automated validation with escalation logic
6. Delivery Agent: Data packaging with audit trails
7. Coordinator Agent: Cross-agent task routing

**Technical Stack:**
- **SQL-on-FHIR v2:** ViewDefinitions transpile to PostgreSQL queries against HAPI database
- **Performance:** In-database execution vs. REST API = 1151x speedup (46ms vs. 53s)
- **Multi-Provider LLM:** Claude (critical tasks) with fallback to OpenAI/Ollama
- **Human-in-Loop Gates:** Mandatory expert approval for SQL execution, requirements validation, data delivery

**The Critical Design Choice:**

AI agents handle 100% of administrative workflow orchestration. Informaticians and biostatisticians validate 100% of technical decisions through mandatory approval gates.

No SQL query executes without expert review.
No dataset delivers without QA approval.
No requirements proceed without validation.

**Observability as Proof:**

LangSmith traces show the exact division of labor:
- Agent execution logs: Which tasks AI completed autonomously (scheduling, routing, status updates)
- Human approval checkpoints: Where SMEs validated technical decisions (SQL queries, cohort definitions, data quality)
- Performance metrics: 95% reduction in turnaround time (weeks → hours), 100% expert validation maintained

The traces prove the architecture: AI owns coordination, humans validate expertise.

**The Meta-Proof:**

Building this system with agentic AI coding demonstrated the concept empirically. If AI can architect, implement, and test 18,000+ lines of multi-agent orchestration code, it can certainly handle meeting scheduling and workflow routing.

Administrative PM work is exactly where AI should own the workflow.

**Production Impact:**

- **Before:** 2-3 weeks per data request (informatician juggling 15+ concurrent requests)
- **After:** Hours from submission to delivery (AI handles orchestration, experts validate technical decisions)
- **Quality:** 100% expert validation maintained through human-in-loop architecture

**Open Source:**

MIT License: https://github.com/jagnyesh/researchflow

The architecture shows a sustainable pattern for AI in regulated technical domains: Let AI handle coordination complexity. Keep humans for irreplaceable technical judgment.

**For AI engineers and technical architects:** How are you designing human-AI boundaries in production systems? What patterns have you found for preserving expert validation while automating coordination?
